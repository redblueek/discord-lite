# discord-lite
A Discord Client, that's lite!

Currently only working on Windows and Linux (maybe), due the thing that i'm not focusing on the mobile version for now.

# FAQ
### What's discord lite? What's the diffrence between normal client and this one?
- I want Discord Lite to be as much lightweight as possible.
  - No stupid UI, animations, etc.
  - maybe a phone version?
    - mobile data usage change (totally not copied from spotify lite)

Those are my plans for this project!

### I saw a guy on X that has the same project name as you. This is so fake!!!!
No it's not. The guy that you saw on X is a person that made **discord lite** *for powerpc architecture* was trying to make discord running on old Macs (https://x.com/dosdude1/status/1834676012896207078).
I'm not releasing discord lite for macs, since 1. it will be just a straight up copy, 2. i dont have a ibook or old imac.
